Todo List App:

In this projects I am building a simple todo list app in the a console.

I am planning to save the data the user inputs locally, in a simple .txt.

My principal goal is to build common projects at first with the minimum usage of tutorials to guide me. I am trying to force myself to forget about tutorials and approach programming with a hands-on mindset.

This project and future ones will be always subject to changes, if I find a new idea worth adding.
