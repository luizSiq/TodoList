Todo List App:

In this projects I am building a simple todo list app, at first it will be a console app, but I am planning to change for a web app.

I am planning to save the data the user inputs locally, in a simple .txt, in the future I may add a database or not, will depend on my future ideas.

This will be my first project out of many.

My principal goal is to build common projects at first with the minimum usage of tutorials to guide me. I am trying to force myself to forget about tutorials and approach programming with a hands-on mindset.

This project and future ones will be always subject to changes, if I find a new idea worth adding.
